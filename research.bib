	abstract={Interpersonal communication among a group of users employing different media types is becoming more and more widespread in computing and telecommunications. Group communication places a variety of new requirements onto the underlying communications architecture and although many existing protocols and services do offer some limited support for multicast group communication, these new requirements make it difficult to find efficient and comprehensive solutions. The impact of multimedia group communication on the communication system and the way in which existing systems, international standardization bodies and researchers cope with these challenges is the subject of this paper. First the characteristics and requirements of multimedia group applications are discussed and illustrated by examples of existing group applications. Subsequently a survey of the kind of support available in today's communication system is presented. In addition the ongoing discussion about the standardization of group communication within ISO and ITU and the direction these efforts take is briefly summarized. Further, some selected examples of research projects which deal with different communication and protocol related aspects of multimedia group communication are presented which give an indication of the trends in this area.}

A technique that enabled dynamic network address translation of the IP address and TCP port number combinations in packet headers was implemented in an experimental network. Two tests were conducted: one to demonstrate that it is possible to disrupt an adversary's ability to sniff network traffic effectively, and another to show that the ability of intrusion detection tools to detect an adversary can be improved. The tests were successful},

Its stated purpose is to provide an additional means in which networks, and the services that reside on them, can be protected from adversarial compromise.  This report has a two-fold objective.  First is to provide the reader with an overview of this emerging Dynamic Defenses technology using Dynamic Network Address Translation (Dynat).   This  “structure overview” is concentrated in the body of the report, and describes the important attributes of the technology.  The second objective is to provide a framework that can be used to help in the classification and assessment of the different types of dynamic defense technologies along with some related capabilities and limitations},

A novel concept of dynamic honey pot is presented which mimics the ancient battle diagrams to bewilder the adversary by changing the role of every hopping station pseudo-randomly. Thereafter a full service hopping framework and synchronization scheme of Spokesman are introduced. Then a distributed prototype is carried out through mobile Java agent. Our experimental works demonstrate that full hopping tactic has better performance for active cyber-defense. Moreover, the overheads of handover and synchronization during service hopping are also discussed in this paper.},

	abstract={Sophisticated worms that use precomputed hitlists of vulnerable targets are especially hard to contain, since they are harder to detect, and spread at rates where even automated defenses may not be able to react in a timely fashion. Recent work has examined a proactive defense mechanism called network address space randomization(NASR) whose objective is to harden networks. The idea behind NASR is that hitlist information could be rendered stale if nodes are forced to frequently change their IP addresses. However, the originally proposed DHCP-based implementation may induce passive failures on hosts. The risk of such collateral damage also makes it harder to perform address changes. In this paper we examine an alternative approach to NASR that allows both more aggressive address changes and also eliminates the problem of connection failures, at the expense of increased implementation and deployment cost. Rather than controlling address changes through a DHCP server, we explore the design and performance of transparent address obfuscation (TAO). In TAO, network elements transparently change the external address of internal hosts, while ensuring that existing connections on previously used addresses are preserved without any adverse consequences. In this paper we present the TAO approach in more detail and examine its performance.}

	abstract={Quantifying security is very hard and, although there are many proposals of security metrics in the literature, no consensual quantitative security metric has been proposed so far. A key difficulty is that security is, usually, more influenced by what is unknown about a system than by what is known about it. In this paper we present the idea of trust-based metrics, which are based on the idea of quantifying and exposing the trustworthiness relationship between a system and its owner. We defend that they represent a powerful alternative to traditional security metrics and are much easier to obtain. As an instantiation, we propose minimum untrustworthiness as a low-cost high-reward trust-based metric that can be easily used to assess and compare security aspects. We discuss what does it express, show how it can be computed and what are its advantages. Finally, we present preliminary work on the definition of an untrustworthiness benchmark for database configurations.},
