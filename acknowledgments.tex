\par I would like to thank my wife, Caitlin, for putting up with late nights, missed phone calls, and many terrible revisions. Her patience has been astounding. Without her support this would have not been possible. Also, thanks to Dr. Mullins for giving me the freedom to direct my own work, yet always being willing to provide advice when needed.
