\lettrine{D}{escribe} the results you obtained when applying the design described in Chapter 3.
At the same time, provide a running analysis of the results. This analysis is probably
the most important part of the whole written thesis, because this is where your real
insights into the problem/solution are documented. Avoid simply showing
plots/tables of results with no analysis.
