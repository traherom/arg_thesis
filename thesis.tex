% The afit-etd class requires the following packages: url, refcount, graphicx,
%                                                     sf298, hyperref
%
% Required files to support the afit-etd class are:
%      afit-etd.cls
%      afitlogo.pdf or afitlogo.eps
%      af298.sty (slight modifications required to fix a 'glitch')
% All of the required files must be located in your LaTeX search path.  The
% easiest place to put them is in the working directory along side with your
% thesis.tex file.
%
% Additional files used in this shell but not required are:
%     thesis.bib (used as an example only)
%     thesnum3.bst (can be replaced with any other bibliography style file)
%     CampusPhoto.pdf and CampusPhoto.eps (used as an example only)
% This shell will not process without these files, but if you delete sample
% text and replace the BST file with another, then these will not be required
% at all.


% The following packages and macros are recommended but not required:
\usepackage{xcolor}                  % standard package for including colors
\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib} % better citations
                                % especially when including a string of
                                % citations
%\newcommand\citenum[1]{#1}
\usepackage{subfig}

% Packages for fonts
\usepackage{amssymb}  % math symbols (amsmath & amsthm are defined in afit-etd)
\usepackage[printonlyused]{acronym}
\usepackage{lettrine} % provides dropped characters to lead off a paragraph.
                      % These are not required, but some people like them at
                      % the start of each chapter.
\usepackage{bm}       % The most comprehensive package for bold math figures
\usepackage{textcomp} % \texttimes, \textdegree, \textohm, \textmu

% Packages for tables
\usepackage{booktabs} % improved rules (lines) for tables
\usepackage{dcolumn}  % align at decimal in tables
\usepackage{multirow} % table elements spanning multiple rows

\graphicspath{{figures/}} % reduce clutter by storing figures elsewhere

% Defining macros for all references makes it easy to change format later from
% "Equation 1" to "Eqn (1)", for example
\newcommand{\fig}[1]{Figure~\ref{fig:#1}}
\newcommand{\tab}[1]{Table~\ref{tab:#1}}
\newcommand{\eq}[1]{Equation~\eqref{eq:#1}}
\newcommand{\eqtwo}[2]{Equations~\eqref{eq:#1} and \eqref{eq:#2}}

%\acknowledgments{Insert optional acknowledgments or remove/comment out this line completely.} 
% If you prefer to provide "acknowledgements" instead (note the added "e"

%\vita{Insert optional vita or remove/comment out this line completely.}

% The List of Tables and Figures can be omitted if not needed:
%
% \notables  
% \nofigures

% Additional "lists" can be added to the end of the front matter using the
% \addlistof macro.  For example, one might insert a list of symbols using the
%  tabbing environment with:
\addlistof{Symbols}{
\begin{tabbing}
  Symbol\quad \= Definition \kill % This sets up the tab stop
  Symbol \> Definition \\

  $b$ \> body reference frame \\
  $n$ \> navigation reference frame \\
\end{tabbing}

% Alternatives to the preceding list of symbols and the following list of
% acronyms can be created using:
%
% \listofsymbols
% \listofabbreviations[5em]
% 
%% where the corresponding symbols and abbreviations must then be marked at
%% their first occurence in the text with "\addsymbol{Definition}{Symbol}" or
%% "\addabbrev{Definition}{Symbol}", respectively.  If the symbols are
%% too wide for the table, the alloted width can be increased by including
%% an optional width in square brackets, as in  "\listofsymbols[.3in]".  
%% Both of these lists will be listed in the order that they appear in the text.

% The acronym package can be used to add a list of acronyms.  Because
% the acronym formatting is modified to match the AFIT Style Guide,
% the following command must be in the body of the document prior to the

% The following line is required to generate the prefatory pages
\makePrefatoryPages
