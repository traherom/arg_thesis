%\dedication{\centering Insert optional dedication or remove/comment out this line completely.  The text will be centered vertically and horizontally on the page} 

%\acknowledgments{Insert optional acknowledgments or remove/comment out this line completely.} 
% If you prefer to provide "acknowledgements" instead (note the added "e"
% between the "g" and the "m") then add the "e" in the macro name so that

%\vita{Insert optional vita or remove/comment out this line completely.}

% The default disclaimer and copyright statement is included by default.  An

%
% \govtdisclaimer{Alternate Disclaimer.//See the Style Guide for more information}    

% The List of Tables and Figures can be omitted if not needed:
%
% \notables  
% \nofigures

% Additional "lists" can be added to the end of the front matter using the
% \addlistof macro.  For example, one might insert a list of symbols using the
%  tabbing environment with:
%\addlistof{Symbols}{
%\begin{tabbing}
%  Symbol\quad \= Definition \kill % This sets up the tab stop
%  Symbol \> Definition \\
%  $I$    \> current (amps) \\
%  $R$    \> resistance (ohms) \\
%  $V$    \> voltage (volts) \\

%  $rms$ \> root mean square \\
%  $t$ \> true \\
%  $0$ \> nominal\\
%  \null\\
%  \textit{Superscripts}\\
%  $b$ \> body reference frame \\
%  $n$ \> navigation reference frame \\
%\end{tabbing}
%}

% Alternatives to the preceding list of symbols and the following list of
% acronyms can be created using:
%
% \listofsymbols
% \listofabbreviations[5em]
% 
%% where the corresponding symbols and abbreviations must then be marked at
%% their first occurence in the text with "\addsymbol{Definition}{Symbol}" or
%% "\addabbrev{Definition}{Symbol}", respectively.  If the symbols are
%% too wide for the table, the alloted width can be increased by including
%% an optional width in square brackets, as in  "\listofsymbols[.3in]".  
%% Both of these lists will be listed in the order that they appear in the text.
